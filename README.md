# hello-world

Is everyone aware that life is that short?

//I guess that´s why people is still all mad at everyone...

For instance, my own self lacks the ability to separate sadness from happiness, since every time I´m into one of 'em
the other makes its way through. It makes my world drift through time and space, it's my inner motor, my fuel.

How boring would life be if any two of 'em where to miss?
